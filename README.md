# Aurduino-Based-Radar-System

To build an Arduino based 360-degree RADAR system using HCSR04 Ultrasonic sensor and a Stepper Motor.

Radar is an object-detection system that uses radio waves to determine the
range, angle, or velocity of objects. It can be used to detect aircraft, ships,
spacecraft, guided missiles, motor vehicles, weather formations, and terrain. A
radar system consists of a transmitter producing electromagnetic waves in the radio
or microwaves domain, a transmitting antenna, a receiving antenna (often the same
antenna is used for transmitting and receiving) and a receiver and processor to
determine properties of the object(s). Radio waves (pulsed or continuous) from the
transmitter reflect off the object and return to the receiver, giving information
about the object's location and speed.
